We started it with a product manager and me, a few months later we had a 2nd engineer working with us in our HQ in Berlin and a 3rd engineer working remote from South America while his visa was being processed. In the begin we didn’t feel the need of having a specific process, we used a kanban board to prioritise and track progress on user stories.</p>\n<p>As the team continued to grow and our remote engineer relocated to Berlin and joined us in our headquarter we started having a feeling that we could be more productive.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on the topic with fellow colleagues and our senior management we decide to address this situation by changing our software development process, the main reasons for this change are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anticipation of team growth</li>\n<li>Feeling that we could be more efficient</li>\n<li>No metrics for tracking team performance</li>\n<li>We were looking for a more efficient way of getting things done</li>\n<li>Mentoring available</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Is scrum the way to go?</h2>\n<p>I first heard of scrum at my university time back in 2012, the topic was really interesting to me and I studied and obtained a certification of “Professional Scrum Master”, however many companies that I worked didn’t use scrum and many others used what they described as “scrum-like”, which means that they tailored scrum to the needs and reality of the company. I ended up learning that many times that can completely twist the process and can kill many of the benefits of scrum.</p>\n<h2>Scrum Theory</h2>\n<p>Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk (Schwaber and Sutherland, 2017).</p>\n<p>Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transparency</li>\n<li>Inspection</li>\n<li>Adaptation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.</p>\n<p>Transparency requires those aspects be defined by a common standard so observers share a common understanding of what is being seen.</p>\n<p>For example</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A common language referring to the process must be shared by all participants; and,</li>\n<li>Those performing the work and those inspecting the resulting increment must share a\ncommon definition of “Done”.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Inspection</h3>\n<p>Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances. Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way\nof the work. Inspections are most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors at\nthe point of work.</p>\n<h3>Adaptation</h3>\n<p>If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted. An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize\nfurther deviation.</p>\n<p>Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation, as described in the Scrum</p>\n<p>Events section of this document:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sprint Planning</li>\n<li>Daily Scrum</li>\n<li>Sprint Review</li>\n<li>Sprint Retrospective</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Adopting scrum</h2>\n<p>We were working on a green field project that meant that we knew exactly what we should be working on in the next couple of weeks, we scheduled a kick-off meeting in which we reviewed scrum, roles, values and artifacts. That was a very important moment for the team in the direction of transparency, previously me (tech lead) and the product manager were sharing the role of product owner, we made a clean cut that day and the product manager took the role as product owner, I took the role of scrum master and we reviewed also the role of the development team. Clear roles, expectations and accountability were key for moving forward.</p>\n<p>We did our first sprint planning and use the criteria “what do we forecast we can achieve in the next 2 weeks?” as the starting point to come up with our first sprint, since we didn’t have any metric to tell us the current speed of the team.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"Adopting Scrum","date":"August 18, 2019","description":"TBD"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/adopting-scrum/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/a-practical-guide-to-cd-java-applications/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Practical guide to CD Java Applications"}},"next":null}}
