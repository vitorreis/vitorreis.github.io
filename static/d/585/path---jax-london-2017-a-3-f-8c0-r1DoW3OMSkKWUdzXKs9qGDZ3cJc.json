At foodora nothing new there since we are already using this architecture since January 2017,  but the presentation was a nice review and reaffirms that we are going in the right direction.</p>\n<p>@danielbryantuk consultant and author of the book Containerizing Continuous Delivery in Java (O’REILLY, 2018) reviewed the flows of CI/CD and discussed the particularities of Java and containers, Oracle is going all in supporting containerized apps with Java 9, the ability of run an optimized JRE with only the resources that your application needs is on our way (see java 9 modules)</p>\n<p>@DonaldOJDK Senior Director of Product Management for Oracle talked about the new release cycles of java and how the language will move forward faster than ever with a new release each 6 months. There will be versions that will not be maintained for longer which will force the companies that choose this path to always upgrade the java version of their projects, but if your company is more conservative you still have the option to stay in the versions that are long time supported.</p>\n<p>It’s a common agreement that our team would enjoy it more if the speakers had dive deep into the topics, but it’s also understandable that due to the small duration of the sessions it’s challenging to do so. Now it’s time to share the knowledge internally with teams and prepare towards the future of fast pace java releases.</p>\n<p>Happy coding.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Jax London 2017 - Conference Highlights","date":"October 15, 2017","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/jax-london-2017/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/building-scalable-apis-with-aws-api-gateway/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Building Scalable APIs with AWS API Gateway"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/a-practical-guide-to-cd-java-applications/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Practical guide to CD Java Applications"}}}}
